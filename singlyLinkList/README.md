# Singly Linked List Implementation

This C++ program implements a singly linked list data structure along with various operations such as appending a node, prepending a node, inserting a node after a specific node, deleting a node by its key, updating a node by its key, and printing the contents of the list.

## Introduction

A singly linked list is a linear data structure where each element in the list is stored in a node. Each node contains two fields: a key (to uniquely identify the node) and data. Each node also contains a pointer to the next node in the sequence.

## Features

- Append Node: Add a node to the end of the list.
- Prepend Node: Add a node to the beginning of the list.
- Insert Node After: Insert a node after a specific node in the list.
- Delete Node By Key: Delete a node with a specified key from the list.
- Update Node By Key: Update the data of a node with a specified key.
- Print: Print the contents of the singly linked list.
- Clear Screen: Clear the console screen for better user experience.

## How to Use

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository containing the code.
2. Open the code in a C++ compatible IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the code.

## Operations

### 1. Append Node
   - Appends a new node to the end of the list.

### 2. Prepend Node
   - Prepends a new node to the beginning of the list.

### 3. Insert Node After
   - Inserts a new node after a specific node in the list.

### 4. Delete Node By Key
   - Deletes a node with a specified key from the list.

### 5. Update Node By Key
   - Updates the data of a node with a specified key.

### 6. Print
   - Prints the contents of the singly linked list.

### 7. Clear Screen
   - Clears the console screen for better readability.
