# Queue Implementation in C++

This C++ program implements a basic queue data structure along with various operations such as enqueue, dequeue, check if the queue is empty or full, count the number of elements in the queue, and display the elements of the queue.

## Introduction

A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted from one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front). This implementation utilizes an array to store the elements of the queue.

## Features

- Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove and return the element from the front of the queue.
- isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
- isFull: Check if the queue is full.
- Count: Count the number of elements in the queue.
- Display: Display all elements of the queue.
- Clear Screen: Clear the console screen for better user experience.
