# Queue Implementation in C++

This is a simple implementation of a queue data structure in C++. The code provides functionalities to enqueue, dequeue, check if the queue is empty or full, count the number of elements in the queue, and display the elements of the queue.

## Features
- Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue.
- Dequeue: Remove and return the element from the front of the queue.
- isEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.
- isFull: Check if the queue is full.
- Count: Count the number of elements in the queue.
- Display: Display all elements of the queue.
- Clear Screen: Clear the console screen.

## Usage
1. Compile the code in your C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to perform various queue operations.

## Code Structure
- The `queue` class encapsulates the queue data structure and its operations.
- The `main` function demonstrates the usage of the queue class by providing a menu-driven interface to interact with the queue.

## Compilation
```bash
g++ queue.cpp -o queue
