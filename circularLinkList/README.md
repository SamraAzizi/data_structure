## Introduction

A circular linked list is a variation of a linked list in which the last node points back to the first node. This creates a circular structure. In this implementation, each node contains two fields: a key and data. The key is used to uniquely identify each node.

## Features

- Append a node to the end of the list.
- Prepend a node to the beginning of the list.
- Insert a node after a specific node in the list.
- Delete a node by its unique key.
- Update the data of a node by its key.
- Print the contents of the circular linked list.
- Clear the screen for better user experience.

## How to Use

To use this program, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository containing the code.
2. Open the code in a C++ compatible IDE or text editor.
3. Compile and run the code.

## Operations

### 1. Append Node
   - Appends a new node to the end of the list.

### 2. Prepend Node
   - Prepends a new node to the beginning of the list.

### 3. Insert Node After
   - Inserts a new node after a specific node in the list.

### 4. Delete Node By Key
   - Deletes a node with a specified key from the list.
