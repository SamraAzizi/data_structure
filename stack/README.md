# Stack Implementation in C++

This C++ program implements a stack data structure along with various operations such as push, pop, check if the stack is empty or full, peek at a specific position, count the number of elements in the stack, change the value at a specific position, and display the elements of the stack.

## Introduction

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are inserted and removed from the same end called the top of the stack. This implementation utilizes an array to store the elements of the stack.

## Features

- Push: Add an element to the top of the stack.
- Pop: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack.
- isEmpty: Check if the stack is empty.
- isFull: Check if the stack is full.
- Peek: View the element at a specific position in the stack.
- Count: Count the number of elements in the stack.
- Change: Change the value at a specific position in the stack.
- Display: Display all elements of the stack.
- Clear Screen: Clear the console screen for better user experience.
